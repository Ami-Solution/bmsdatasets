## Short description

This tool allows users to examine, distribute, and analyze solar resource data for the United States and assists in making decisions about optimal locations for solar plants. 

## Description

This tool shows sites for developing utility-scale solar
power. It allows users to examine, distribute, and
analyze solar resource data for the United States and
assists in making decisions about optimal locations for
solar plants. It also allows users to explore temporal
and spatial aspects of NREL's solar resource data and
download the resource data for use outside of the tool,
for example, in the System Advisor Model or SAM.

## Value

Solar Prospector assists the solar industry by providing
critical information about the location of solar resources,
land ownership, and general infrastructure in an easy-touse
map format. Users can quickly download hourly solar
resource data for specific locations and quickly perform
temporal analyses for any location in the United States.
