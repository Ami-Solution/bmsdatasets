## Description

The OpenPV Project is a collaborative effort among
government, industry, and the public to compile a
comprehensive database of PV installation data for
the United States, providing PV system price and
installed capacity data at the state level.

## Value

The data collected is actively maintained by the
contributors and are always changing to provide an
evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the U.S. solar power
market. Additionally, the application provides several
innovative interactive tools to explore the information
and derive knowledge from the data in the database.
