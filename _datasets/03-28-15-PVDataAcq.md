## Short Description

Users can explore data visually thru the application and download only the portions of the data necessary for analysis. 

## Detailed Description

The PV Data Acquisition application provides the
access, both public and private, to PV performance
data across the United States.

## Value

These data are difficult to find and so numerous that
they are difficult to download in bulk. This application
provides access to these data in a way that allows users
to explore them visually and to download only the
portions of the data needed for analysis.
