## Short description

This API lists the incentives found in the Database for State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) spreadsheet by location. 

## Description

The Energy Incentives tool API lists the incentives
found in the DSIRE quantitative spreadsheet by
location. This is the current version of the energy
incentives API. Previous versions have been
depreciated and its users are encouraged to migrate
to this newly enhanced version. Note that this data
has not been updated for over a year because of the
DSIRE hiatus.

## Value

This tool provides a quantitative way to get the DSIRE
data into online tools.
