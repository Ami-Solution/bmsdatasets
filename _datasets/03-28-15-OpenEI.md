## Short description

OpenEI provides data access, generative data use, key knowledge derivation tools, and synthetic datasets that can help inform energy policy and investment decisions. It enables the development of knowledge bases and datasets API's and Web services. It houses the Transparent Cost Database (TCDB) and the Utility Rate Database (URDB). 


## Description

This open-data “platform of platforms” provides
data access, generative data use, key knowledge
derivation tools, and synthetic datasets that can
help inform energy policy and investment decisions.
OpenEI also enables the development of knowledge
bases and datasets and the delivery of energy-related
data, application programming interfaces (APIs),
and Web services. It houses the Transparent Cost
Database (TCDB) and the Utility Rate Database
(URDB).

## Value

OpenEI supports the DOE fulfillment of open government
standards: transparency, public participation, and
collaboration. Built utilizing the standards and practices
of the Linked Open Data community, the OpenEI platform
is much more robust and powerful than typical websites
and databases.
