## Short description

Users can see how various inputs such as system size, location, and project costs, impact the economics of a project from the perspectives of both a potential customer and the sponsoring utility.

## Description

The Community Solar Scenario Tool (CSST) provides a
"first cut" analysis of different community or shared
solar program options. The tool has been created
primarily for smaller municipal utilities, electric
cooperatives, and state and local advocates. This
model allows users to see how various inputs, such as
system size, location, and project costs, impact the
economics of a project from the perspectives of both a
potential customer and the sponsoring utility.

## Value

The CSST allows users to get an idea of the community
solar project economics without having to use a more
sophisticated tool such as SAM. It is intended as a "first
look" tool.
