## Short Description

This API provides access to PV performance data collected by NREL for systems throughout the country.

## Detailed Description

The PVDAQ API provides access to photovoltaic
performance data collected by NREL for systems
throughout the country. The PVDAQ mapping
application uses these data to help industry and
government planners study solar array efficiency.

## Value

These data are difficult to find and so numerous that
they are difficult to download in bulk. This application
provides access to these data in a way that allows users
to explore them visually and to download only the
portions of the data needed for analysis.
