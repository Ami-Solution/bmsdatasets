## Short Description

Users can explore data visually thru the application and download only the portions of the data necessary for analysis. 

## Detailed Description

The PVDAQ API provides access to photovoltaic
performance data collected by NREL for systems
throughout the country. The PVDAQ mapping
application uses these data to help industry and
government planners study solar array efficiency.

## Value

These data are difficult to find and so numerous that
they are difficult to download in bulk. This application
provides access to these data in a way that allows users
to explore them visually and to download only the
portions of the data needed for analysis.
